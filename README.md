## Daily Log

Day 1-2

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. Also, I never knew that the <canvas> element is perfect for making games.

Day 3-4

**Today's Progress**: Worked on main Flexbox and z-index deals with parent and children, hover mouse shows very nice background, click on any planet, and shows JSON specfic infomation. It deals with library TweenMax, but I can use transform or transition instead of but I did not. 

**Thoughts:** I was struggling to understand how animationPlayState work such as "running": "paused". I have reviewed the docs on website that what I search for, so I can get their information and playing around with statement after click function. Also, I was using animation: rotate 4s linear infinite; and I have to put @keyframe for rotate from 0% to 360%. I had to look up on webstie to get some concept.

Day 5-6

**Today's Progress**: worked on main Flexbox, DOM JavaScript, setTimeout(), animation such as @keyframes

**Thoughts**: At the first, I was without looking at their or tutorial online courses I was thought loop able to stop an infinite loop in JavaScript but I was wrong, so I have decided to use the method called setTimeout because of the iterate very quickly.
