## Daily Log

Day 1-2

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. Also, I never knew that the <canvas> element is perfect for making games.

Day 3-4

**Today's Progress**: Worked on main Flexbox and z-index deals with parent and children, hover mouse shows very nice background, click on any planet, and shows JSON specfic infomation. It deals with library TweenMax, but I can use transform or transition instead of but I did not. 

**Thoughts:** I was struggling to understand how animationPlayState work such as "running": "paused". I have reviewed the docs on website that what I search for, so I can get their information and playing around with statement after click function. Also, I was using animation: rotate 4s linear infinite; and I have to put @keyframe for rotate from 0% to 360%. I had to look up on webstie to get some concept.

Day 5-6

**Today's Progress:** worked on main Flexbox, DOM JavaScript, setTimeout(), animation such as @keyframes

**Thoughts**: At the first, I was without looking at their or tutorial online courses I was thought loop able to stop an infinite loop in JavaScript but I was wrong, so I have decided to use the method called setTimeout because of the iterate very quickly.

Day 7-10

**Today's Progress:** a simple CRUD project with Mongodb and Express 

**Thoughts:** I need to improve on HTML radio. I had struggled with boolean

Day 11

**Today's Progress**: To play the game, you will only have 6 remain mistakes or your game will be over. It is fun to play the game to guess the letters! 

**Thoughts**: I made a project with vanilla JavaScript. I have to create the split method and toUpperCase() because sometime user puts lower case. It will automate to captial letters no matter what. Also, it creates array so it can loop with length after random of array words that I make up the words. I learnt that the autofocus attribute in HTML could be input, button, textarea, and select. For one example, when we put html two input fields with an autofocus to force a blinking cursor to appear in your target field, which will draw the users eye and instruct them to begin typing.  It cant have two autofocus only one. Same concept as id in JavaScript.

Day 11-12

**Today's Progress**: I had to look up at learn.Freecodecamp.org Curriculum on **Object Oriented Programming** section for couple of hours. 

**Thoughts**: instanceof and constructor are similar. However, instanceof method is better over constructor because it checks the type of an object intead of overwritten. Also, the prototype is extremely useful for DRY because the properties are added all at once. I do not want to use the constructor to be duplicated variable. 

Day 13 

**Today's Progress**: I had to review again forEach vs Map. I was working on API section and there are so many object literal. I would like to create new array return object, but when using **foreach** is always return undefined.  

**Thoughts**:
