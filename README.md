## Daily Log

Day 1-2 [snake project coding challenge 7](/codingChallenge7)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. Also, I never knew that the <canvas> element is perfect for making games in HTML instead of DOM objects
