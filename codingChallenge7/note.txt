I never knew that the <canvas> element is perfect for making games.
<canvas> element perfect to make game
I build very simple a line is <canvas id="myCanvas" width="600" height="500"></canvas> inside of body element 


create_snake body method 
You will want to start the game with 5 size of snake every time you eat and you will grow one size. you 
will need to create variable that is let and be aware that do not use const because varilable will not mutable. 
the snake body size start with 5 and assign to the variable. you will want to create key pair with object and push 
x instead of y. remember that x is going to row and y is going to conlum.  

create_food method 
You will want to create key pair of object with Math random number with round method. 
    const ow = 600;
const oh = 500;

    let cw=20;
    food = {
        x:Math.round(Math.random()*(ow-cw)/cw),
        y:Math.round(Math.random()*(oh-cw)/cw)
    }

to create graph 
    graph always right or up are positive and left and down are negative. 

.setInterval 
    it has two parameters are required the first one is function, the second is millseces.
